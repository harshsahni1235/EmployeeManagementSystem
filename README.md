This is a basic Employee Management System app that is implementing CRUD operations.

For Backend Development - Springboot framework is used with MySQL Database.
    Springboot version - 3.0.2
    MySql 8.0.32 community version
   
#Added 4 dependencies while creating a project:
		  1.Springboot Dev Tools
	    2.Spring Data JPA
	    3.Spring Web
	    4.MySql Driver
      
 A spring based eclipse based IDE named Spring Tool Suite(STS) is used for for writing backend.
 
 In this project we are creating a REST Api to GET, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE employee details from the system.
 REST api is connected with MySQL database to fetch and send details of Employee.
 
For Frontend Development - React.Js is used.
      This frontend consumes our REST Api which we have created in SpringBoot and we have integrated both to work together that becomes an EMPLOYEE Management System App which can ADD, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE the details of Employee.
